This approach emphasizes honing skills, gaining expertise, and fostering a deep understanding of a particular subject, process, or set of responsibilities. Whether it's refining a craft, mastering a specific set of tools, or consistently tackling similar challenges, working with the same thing allows individuals to build efficiency, competence, and a strong foundation. It's a deliberate and strategic choice that often leads to heightened performance and a profound sense of mastery in a given area.
