        In CSS, simple selectors are fundamental for targeting and styling specific elements on a web page.
        These selectors allow you to select HTML elements based on their type, class, or ID.
        A simple type selector targets a specific element based on its HTML tag, such as p
        for paragraphs or h1 for level 1 headers. This type of selector is used when you want to apply
        a style to all elements of a particular type on the page.
    </p>

    <p class="para2">
        Furthermore, class and ID selectors are essential for increased specificity in element selection.
        A class selector, preceded by a period (e.g., .my-class), applies to all elements that share the same class
        in their class attribute. On the other hand, an ID selector, preceded by a hash (e.g., #my-id),
        selects a single element on the page with the corresponding ID. These selectors provide more precise control
        over styling and are useful for customizing specific elements without affecting similar elements on the page.
        In summary, simple selectors in CSS are essential tools for creating effective styles and
         ensuring consistent visual presentation on a web page.
