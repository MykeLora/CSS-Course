    <h2>Syntax de css </h2>

    <p>In the peculiar town of Whimsyville, where reality took coffee breaks and imagination ran the town council meetings, lived a character named Zara Zigglesnoot.
        Zara had a pet pineapple named Sir Squigglesworth, who moonlighted as a detective solving fruit mysteries. One day, a fleet of flying teacups invaded the town,
        pouring a rainbow of tea that turned everyone into singing unicorns. As chaos ensued, Zara hatched a plan to trade her collection of whimsical socks with the Teacup Queen for a potion that would restore normalcy.
        Little did she know, the Teacup Queen had a penchant for sock puppet theater, and the negotiations turned into a sock spectacular that saved Whimsyville in the quirkiest way imaginable.
